# NodeJS backend

We have two different nodejs processes running in our backend.
One is a webserver that allows users using the frontend to subsribe
to the data of the two relevant kafka topics `trade_data` and `buy_sell_advice`.

The other process is a NodeJS based consumer of the `sorted_raw_trade_data` topic
and producer to the `trade_data` topic.

Our Kafka topic and partition initialization code is also included in this repository.
